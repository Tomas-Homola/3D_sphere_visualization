# App for solid view of 3D sphere

This app provides basics for the 3D solid view of a sphere created by subsequently dividing a simple octahedron (user can specify the number of divisions). The camera can be moved around the sphere by changing the values of zenit and azimut or switched from parralel to perspective projection. As for the sphere illumination, the app uses the **Phong model** defined by diffuse, ambient and specular coefficients. The user can choose either flat or Gouraud shading.
